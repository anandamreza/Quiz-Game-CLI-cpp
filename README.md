# Quiz-Game-CLI-cpp

A simple multiple-choice quiz game written in C++. The program displays questions with four options, accepts player input, checks correctness, and calculates a final score. Each question is represented using a `Questions` class, while the overall game flow is handled by a `GameManager`. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming in C++, including classes, vectors, and basic input/output handling.
